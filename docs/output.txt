Statistics Changes

Statistics for our ████████████████ games are provided by the same service that keeps official stats for the NFL, and your league is scored according to these official stats. Occasionally we receive changes to the stats we initially post after the games on Sunday or Monday nights. This happens when a stat was incorrectly reported during a game. Please note that you will rarely, if ever, see these changes reflected in published box scores, whether on-line or in print. However, we include all stat changes that we receive by Tuesday at midnight ET each week. _____

In the Trenches

Check out our In the Trenches column every Wednesday for a look at all the news coming out of the recent weekend's games. We'll cover injuries, roster moves, depth chart changes and more. Check the ███████ News area - click News, ███████ News on the toolbar - for In the Trenches, and make sure your ███████ facts are up-to-date. Check the ███████ News area throughout the week for more news and advice from the experts. _____

█████████████

Welcome to █████████████, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer ████████████████ roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com<. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of ███████ players just like yourself! Question - ██████████████, ████████, █████████

I have to bench either █████████, ██████████, ████████████ or Laveranues █████. Who would you bench this week? Answer - GG

█████████ always seems to save his best for AFC West matchups, and should have a big game against the Broncos. A Monday Night audience only adds to his motivation. █████ has become ██████████ No. 1 WR, and will be facing an erratic ███████████ secondary. The ████ may also have to play catch-up, and throw the ball at ███████████. ██████████ is facing one of the most porous secondaries in the NFC (███████). We must recommend sitting Booker, who is facing the fundamentally superior █████████ defense. Question - ██████████, ████████, ██████████

This week I was able to pick up Dominic Rhodes, the backup to ██████████████. I also have Ahman Green vs. Tampa Bay and ██████████████ vs. █████████, along with ████████████ and █████████████. Which two running backs should I start this week? Answer - GG

Rhodes is still an unproven player, despite his excellent game against the Chiefs. Alstott has hurt the Packers before, and ran a decisive 37-yard TD in the teams' first meeting this year. The inconsistent Smith is a risky start against the Patriots. You simply have to go with your two best players here. Green is playing in a pivotal NFC Central matchup, and no one has been able to stop ██████ yet. Question - Jason Yearot, ████████████, ████████

████████████████ is off this week, and ████████████████ is my backup. Should I use █████ vs. ███████████, or grab ███████████ off waivers? Also, would you start the █████ defense vs. Carolina or the Bears defense vs. █████████? Answer - GG

███████ showed a lot of grit in last week's game against the Chargers, and is facing a vulnerable Colts defense. But he is banged up, and ██████████ might test an inconsistent ███████████ secondary at times. Neither is a great start, but ██████████ is healthy, and ███████ could hurt your numbers if he takes another big hit and leaves the game. The Bears won't be tested by █████████'s running game, but █████████ and Kevin ███████ may hurt them. Carolina doesn't have the running game or receiving talent (besides ███████████████) to challenge the ████████, who are the better pick. _____

Tip of the Week

Shawn Abel, ██████████, ████████: It is time to stop recommending ███████ teams bench their quarterback when facing the █████████ Ravens. I benched ████████████ last week in favor of ████████████████ and it cost me dearly. ███████████, █████████ and ███████ have proven the past three weeks that a quality quarterback can torch █████████'s defense.
