Hey ████!

How are you?? I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently. I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.

 I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story. Do you remember when ████ Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead? ████ was talking to my boss, ████████████, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts. When he got off the phone, █████ told me who he was talking to and the name ████ Mee struck me as familiar. I asked █████ if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes. So I tell him the Big Mac story and █████ picks up the phone and calls ████ to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him. Poor thing says "yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments..." I could tell he was embarrassed. I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.

 I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month. We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time. I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well. They immediately said "████ Arnold!" Shocked the hell out of me, honestly. They were very funny in saying that I had made a "bad trade" by marrying my husband instead of you. I told them I would keep that in mind.... ;- I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head. They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with ██████████████.

 Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today. I really do hope you're doing well. Please drop me a line when you aren't trading up a storm...

 Warm regards,  
███████
